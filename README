Shruthi-1, a better digital/analog hybrid MIDI monosynth.

This project is a redesign of the original Shruti-1, with a focus on manufacturability and cost reduction. It also uses an ATMega644p to provide new features in the OS (including a larger selection of oscillator algorithms, a bigger wavetable, and a tiny sequencer).
