This is an experimental firmware for the Shruthi-1 digital board facilitating
the development of oscillator algorithms.

Only one oscillator is running, VCF is fully open, no resonance ;
VCA is fully open.

The 4 knobs are mapped to:
- Oscillator coarse pitch (MIDI note)
- Oscillator fine pitch
- Oscillator parameter
- Oscillator waveform
