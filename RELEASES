v0.92 (work in progress) -------------------------------------------------------

- SysEx Patch request command (0x11 0x00). Upon reception of this command, the
Shruthi dumps the currently edited patch. Might be useful for an editor!
- Code size optimization saved 460 bytes.
- Patches can be tweaked from the load/save page. In this case, the 4 knobs have
the functions assigned to them in the performance page for this patch.
- ADC scanning code overhaul. The benefits are a more reactive UI and...
programmer support.
- Different options are available for using the 4 CV : 4 CV ins (assignable in
mod matrix), 32-knobs programmer, or simple mapping to cutoff, param1/param2 for
pedals and joystick.
- The Shruthi-1 can now be configured to boot directly on the presets page (aka
"presets mode").
- The shape of the envelope (approximation of an exponential) has been refined.
- Support for NRPN increment/decrement.
- External eeproms larger than 64kb are supported, up to 512kb. Note that when
a 512kb eeprom is used, the last 64kb block is not used (this is due to the
fact that 16-bit arithmetic is used to compute addresses, and that the
address space includes the 16kb of internal eeprom).
- SysEx bulk transfer protocol can now handle address spaces of up to 64kbytes.
- To make more room for upcoming feature, the waves wavetable has been
downsampled to 128 samples/waveform instead of 256.

v0.91 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Improved encoder debouncing/decoding algorithm.
- Changed "load" label to "browse" in patch load/save page.

v0.90 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Original release.
